            <h2 class="section-headline">Here's Exactly How We Put Qualified Roofing Business Owners On Your Calendar</h2>
            <div class="steps">
                <div class="step">

                        <h3 class="step-title">Targeted Prospect List</h3>
                        <p>We build a clean, focused list of Roofing business owners who are already spending on ads or can afford real retainers. No scraped junk. No random "maybe one day" brands. Only buyers that match your offer and case studies.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>

                        <p>We write and send the cold emails under your brand. Every message is short, direct, and relevant to how you actually grow their revenue. You never touch an outreach tool, a list, or a sending domain.</p>
                    </div>

                        <p>Our team reads and replies to every response. Time‑wasters, "let's connect someday," and people who don't fit your criteria are filtered out. Only serious, qualified founders move forward to a booked call.</p>

                        <p>When a prospect shows up on a call in your calendar, that's when it counts. If they book and no‑show, you don't pay for that call. Our focus is the same as yours: real conversations that can turn into long‑term retainers.</p>

                <p class="highlight-text">If they don't show up, you don't pay. Simple.</p>
                <p>We carry the cost of research, copy, tools, sending, and reply management. We only win when you are face‑to‑face (or screen‑to‑screen) with a qualified e‑com founder. Your only job is what you already do best: run the call, close the deal, and deliver results.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="risk-body">You've tried the old model: pay a flat retainer, hope the leads are decent, and accept that most never turn into serious conversations. We flipped that on its head. Our incentives are tied directly to live, attended calls on your calendar. If our outreach sucks, we eat it. Not you.</p>
            <p class="risk-body">Most agencies charge you every month and hope something sticks. We don't get paid until there's an actual prospect on a call with you.</p>
